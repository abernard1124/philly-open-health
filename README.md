Mission Statement
=============
The Office of HIV Planning (OHP) writes an annual epidemiologic profile (or "epi" profile) of Philadelphia and eight surrounding counties.  This document includes 219 tables on everything from race/ethnicity to drug use to poverty rates to HIV/AIDS prevalence.  This document has always been designed for print, which means that OHP staff select limited data for presentation.  OHP would like to provide the public with access to the full data sets used in developing the epi profile, beginning by uploading the source files to the web.

Getting Started with Development
======

**Note** We'll be moving to a better structure for project management soon, but in the meantime, please take a look at the requirements_notes.md in this directory for an overview of our 1.0-release feature goals.

Start by creating a user. In the terminal type:

```
rake db:migrate

rails c
u = User.new(email: "yourname@abc.com")
u.password = "yourpassword"
u.confirmation_password = "yourpassword"
u.save
```
